                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p> Tale Together began as a small project by a group of friends who shared a passion for storytelling. What started as a simple online form submission quickly grew into a full-fledged collaborative platform, thanks to the enthusiasm and creativity of our writers. The concept for Tale Together was born inside the walls of BocaCode, a prominent coding school, where the fusion of technical skill and creative vision brought this idea to life. Today, we're proud to host a diverse and active community of storytellers from around the globe. </p>
